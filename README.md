# data_prep_deep_fake
This is a robust deep fake detection dataset code by capturing real time webcam images, annotating images using LabelMe, followed by data augmentation using Albumentations library (including brightness adjustment, flips, rotations, and distortions) while maintaining data integrity through deduplication and proper train-validation-test splits in TensorFlow."
