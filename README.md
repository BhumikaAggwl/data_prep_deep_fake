# data_prep_deep_fake
This is a robust deep fake detection dataset by annotating images using LabelMe, followed by data augmentation using Albumentations library (including brightness adjustment, flips, rotations, and distortions) while maintaining data integrity through deduplication and proper train-validation-test splits in TensorFlow."
